# MiniProject-Analysis-of-the-Human-TNF-Gene
## Objective
To apply bioinformatics skills to download, analyze, and interpret the sequence of the human TNF gene.

The Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) gene encodes a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that is a key regulator in immune response and inflammation. 

Secreted primarily by macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli, TNF interacts with its receptors, TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and TNFRSF1B/TNFBR, to influence a wide range of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation.

TNFÎ± can induce apoptotic or necrotic cell death in specific tumor cell lines and promote cell proliferation and differentiation under certain conditions. 

It is also a potent pyrogen, capable of inducing fever by direct action or through the stimulation of interleukin-1 secretion. 

Chronic overproduction of TNFÎ± is associated with cachexia-like syndrome, particularly in cancer and severe infections. 

Additionally, TNFÎ± contributes to the development of insulin resistance in adipose tissue, linking it to obesity and diabetes.

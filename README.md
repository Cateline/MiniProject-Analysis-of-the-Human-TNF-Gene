# MiniProject-Analysis-of-the-Human-TNF-Gene
## Objective
To apply bioinformatics skills to download, analyze, and interpret the sequence of the human TNF gene.
The Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) gene encodes a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that is a key regulator in immune response and inflammation. Secreted primarily by macrophages, TNF interacts with its receptors, TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and TNFRSF1B/TNFBR, to influence a wide range of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation.
This cytokine contributes to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and certain cancers. It is also associated with conditions like insulin resistance, tuberculosis, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
